# Hardware RNG based on CPU timing jitter

The Jitter RNG provides a noise source using the CPU execution timing jitter.
It does not depend on any system resource other than a high-resolution time
stamp. It is a small-scale, yet fast entropy source that is viable in almost
all environments and on a lot of CPU architectures.

The implementation of the Jitter RNG is independent of any operating system.
As such, it could even run on baremetal without any operating system.

The design of the RNG is given in the documentation found in at
[http://www.chronox.de/jent](http://www.chronox.de/jent). This documentation also covers the full
assessment of the SP800-90B compliance as well as all required test code.

## API

The API is documented in the man page jitterentropy.3.

To use the Jitter RNG, the header file jitterentropy.h must be included.

# Build Instructions

To generate the shared library `make` followed by `make install`.

Besides the Makefile based build system, CMake support is also provided.
This may eases cross compiling or setting the relevant options for BSI's
functionality class NTG.1, like:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DINTERNAL_TIMER=off -DEXTERNAL_CRYPTO=openssl ..
make
```
CMake may also be used on platforms like Windows or MacOS to ease compilation.

# Android

To compile the code on Android, use the following Makefile:

arch/android/Android.mk	-- NDK make file template that can be used to directly
			   compile the CPU Jitter RNG code into Android binaries

## Direct CPU instructions

If the function in jent_get_nstime is not available, you can replace the
jitterentropy-base-user.h with examples from the arch/ directory.

# Testing and Entropy Rate Validation

See `tests/raw-entropy/README.md`.

# Specific Configuration Requirements

In general, no specific configurations are needed to run the Jitter RNG. It is
intended to deliver sufficient entropy.

However, specific configurations are required if you want to comply with certain
rules from certain jurisdictions. The following sections outline such
configuration requirements.

Note, the configurations are given via the `flags` field to be set during
initialization of the Jitter RNG.

## NIST SP800-90B Compliance

If you want to comply with the NIST SP800-90B rules, the following configuration
is needed.

Flags set in the `flags` field:

- `JENT_NTG1` may be set (i.e. the SP800-90B configuration and the
   [NTG.1 configuration](#AIS 20/31 NTG.1 Compliance) can be jointly enabled)

- Either `JENT_FORCE_FIPS` MUST be set or base OS is in FIPS mode (i.e. the
  helper function `jent_fips_enabled` returns true).

The status information provided by `jent_status` must show:

- FIPS mode enabled

- No health test failing

The following test evidence must be provided to NIST for obtaining the ESV
certificate:

- Apply heuristic analysis mandated by NIST on common behavior - see the
  [CMUF Entropy Working Group](https://www.cmuf.org/) for the methodology. More
  information about the working group is given at
  [NIST](https://csrc.nist.gov/presentations/2023/cmuf-entropy-working-group).

- Obtain CAVP certificate for SHAKE-256 conditioner - use
  [ACVP-Parser](https://github.com/smuellerDD/acvpparser)

## AIS 20/31 NTG.1 Compliance

If you want to comply with the German AIS 20/31 rules pertaining to NTG.1, the
following configuration is needed.

Flags set in the `flags` field:

- `JENT_FORCE_FIPS` may be set (i.e. the NTG.1 configuration and the
   [SP800-90B configuration](#NIST SP800-90B Compliance) can be jointly enabled)

- `JENT_NTG1` MUST be set

- Memory buffer size is at least 4 times larger than L1 cache size (typically
  the Jitter RNG can detect the cache size during startup and can set the
  memory buffer size automatically).

The status information provided by `jent_status` must show:

- AIS 20/31 NTG.1 mode enabled

- Memory Block Size equal or larger than four times L1 cache

- Secure Memory enabled

- Internal timer disabled

The following test evidence must be provided to the German BSI for proving
the compliance to NTG.1:

- Measured entropy rate must show rate 8/OSR or higher (see
  `tests/raw-entropy/README.md`):
  
  * Hash loop
  
  * Memory access loop
  
  * Common behavior (SP800-90B restart + runtime tests)

# Version Numbers

The version numbers for this library have the following schema:
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCHLEVEL

Changes in the major number implies API and ABI incompatible changes, or
functional changes that require consumer to be updated (as long as this
number is zero, the API is not considered stable and can change without a
bump of the major version).

Changes in the minor version are API compatible, but the ABI may change.
Functional enhancements only are added. Thus, a consumer can be left
unchanged if enhancements are not considered. The consumer only needs to
be recompiled.

Patchlevel changes are API / ABI compatible. No functional changes, no
enhancements are made. This release is a bug fixe release only. The
consumer can be left unchanged and does not need to be recompiled.
